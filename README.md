# mBotEnhanced
_Forking mBot factory firmware to extend its capabilities_
Makes use of:
* My fork (https://github.com/tiggi78/Makeblock-Libraries) of MakeBlock Libraries (https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries)
* Arduino-Makefile (https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile)

Starting from Makeblock-Libraries/examples/Firmware_For_mBlock/mbot_factory_firmware.ino
